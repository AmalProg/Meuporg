# Meuporg

"Meuporg" (Not the final name though) is a dungeon RPG game in a 2D tiles map environment.

The player is able to progress in a dungeon with X floors. Each floor is randomly generated and got different fauna and flora.
The difficulty will grow for each floor done.

Here is a little screenshot from the actual game (not quite understable at the moment so i added text)

The green square is the player.
The Black one is a wolf, an aggressive enemy.
The White one is a sheep, an passive enemy.
The orange block is a locked door which can be open with a key and let us go to the next folor.

I don't have a todolist cause i just had things when i think it could be great.
It's more a sandbox programming than a real game actually.
