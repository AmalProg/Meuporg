# Meuporg

"Meuporg" (Not the final name though) is a dungeon RPG game in a 2D tiles map environment.
It's developed in C++ using SFML library.

The player is able to progress in a dungeon with X floors. Each floor is randomly generated and got different fauna and flora.
The difficulty will grow for each floor done.

Here is a little screenshot from the actual game :

I'm not good in graphism, so i did the four sprites for player and enemy (the 2 actual enemies got the same sprites) and some
for blocks of the map, others texture are free textures from the internet.
I have to add icons for items.

On this second screenshot we can see the inventory menu :

I don't have a todolist cause i just had things when i think it could be great.
It's more a sandbox programming than a real game actually.
